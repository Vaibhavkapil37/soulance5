        About Us
      </p>
       <p class="text">At <strong>Soulance</strong>, we believe that every soul deserves a space to breathe, reflect, and grow. What started as a vision to create a digital home for emotional well-being has grown into a platform rooted in compassion, connection, and calm.</p>

    <p class="text">We are a small but deeply committed team driven by empathy and purpose.</p>

    <ul class="text">
      <li>Vaibhav Kapil – Visionary & Lead Developer & UI Designer</li>
      <li>Om Malik – Experience Curator </li>
      <li>Madhav Yadav – Research & Innovation Strategist</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">Together, we blend technology with tranquility—designing tools that don’t just work, but feel. Whether it’s through stories, sleep tracking, or moments of stillness, we’re building Soulance to be a space that listens.</p>

    <p class="text">Because sometimes, all you need is a little pause—and a place to belong.</p>
